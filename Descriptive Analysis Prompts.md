Filtered coffee (5 servings) = 475mg

Instant coffee (7 servings) = 420mg
All other combinations are within the recommended safety threshold.
___

## "Which type of coffee allows for the most cups per day without exceeding 400mg of caffeine?"
Response:
Instant coffee allows for the highest number of servings per day (6 cups × 60mg = 360mg) without exceeding the 400mg limit. Espresso follows with 6 cups totaling 378mg.

___

## "Rank the beverage types from least to most caffeine per serving."
Response:
Ranked by caffeine per serving:

Instant coffee (60mg)

Energy drink (80mg)

Espresso (63mg)

Filtered coffee (95mg)

Note: While espresso is more concentrated, filtered coffee has more total caffeine due to larger volume per serving.

___

## "Create a formula or equation that estimates total caffeine based on servings and drink type."
Response:
Let:
